ðŸš€ #1 Proud to share my first ever dashboard in the journey of becoming a Data Analyst!
I created a full Coffee Store Sales Analysis Dashboard using Microsoft Excel, where I practiced:

Data Cleaning:
Removed duplicates, fixed inconsistent formats, and handled missing values.
Standardized country names, unified date formats, and filtered irrelevant records.

Data Transformation:
Created new calculated columns to track total sales, customer loyalty, profit per order, order month, order year, and bulk bills.
Used key Excel functions like IF(), XLOOKUP(), SUMIFS(), SWITCH(), MATCH(), INDEX() and dynamic ranges to enrich the dataset.

Data Analysis & Visualization:
Built pivot tables to summarize sales by country, time, and product type, and many more.
Designed an interactive dashboard with slicers to filter by country and order date.

Visualized KPIs like total sales, top products, sales trends, and customer loyalty impact.
This project marks the start of my hands-on practice in Data Analysis â€” learning to transform raw data into real business insights and present it in a clear, actionable way.
